## Game of Thrones

The show is exciting. I enjoy the **fantasy aspect** of it also. The drama brings you into the story. The **story arcs** of the characters are interesting.

## Tables

This is a table about people I would like or would have liked to meet. They are actors and authors. I find these people interesting. The table shows their name, the reason I would like to meet them, their birthday, and the date of their death (if they have died).

| Name              | Reason                 | Birth | Death |
